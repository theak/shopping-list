# Home Assistant Shopping List Proxy

A simple vibe coded web proxy that displays your Home Assistant shopping list in a clean, modern interface with local completion toggling.

## Environment Variables

```bash
docker run -p 42780:42780 \
  -e HA_URL="http://your-ha-url:8123" \

  akshaykannan/shopping-list
```

    environment:
      - HA_URL=${HA_URL}
